School of code bootcamp warmup task to recreate AirBnB mobile homepage, only using HTML and CSS. First time actually writing something from scratch!

Main goal is to replicate it visually, but also get used to using a basic github workflow of creating branches, committing, pushing, merging into main. Secondary goals are clean code and better understanding of best practices and how to organise and structure my code.
